## **Overview**

Videogames have always held a near and dear place in my heart. Whether it's something relaxing like running a farming village or something more intense like a turn-based strategy game where you build an empire and conquer the world, they're all special to me. One game series that holds a very special place in my heart is the Mario franchise, but more specifically within it, Super Mario World. I have so many childhood memories playing this game on my Game Boy on long car rides and sneaking it into school to play during recess. But the best memories have to be all the times I finally beat some level that I was stuck on for days. Which led me to wonder, just how much better could my computer be than me at playing Mario? This project aims to create a phenomenal AI Mario player through reinforcement learning.

## **Questions**

- Can I teach an AI to be actually good at Mario? Not just memorizing the level it's on, a genuinely strong player.

- Do skills learned from seeing the screen differ from not seeing it?

- Do skills translate across multiple levels, worlds, even games?

- Can a model be trained to essentially recreate a TAS (Tool-assisted speedrun)?

## **Environment**

I used a addon for gym called retrogym which has support for quite a few older emulators as the base for my training environment. Retrogym has a lot of built in integrations for game ROMS, Super Mario World included. Unfortunately, their integration for it was very barebones and not at all ideal for what I wanted to do. The only variables you could use a rewards were your score, coins (which affects score anyways, so really just one is needed), and lives. I wanted so much more, as I was hoping to teach my model to beat a level in one try (any score, coins, bonus lives, etc. should just be a bonus).

## **Environment Setup**

In order to setup my custom environment, I had quite a few things I had to work out. First, how would I actually give incremental rewards to push the model to try and beat a level? Second, how could I define if a level was beaten? Third, how do I stop the model from doing what I call "idiot actions" like pausing the game, accidentally quitting, etc.? To tackle the first problem, I had to look into if there was a variable in the game that tracks the player's position in a level. To find this and any other variables, I had to follow memory maps (locations in RAM on where these variables are set to save to) and then actually pull those values from the emulator using retrogym's handy game integration tool. I needed the location in memory in base 16 (e.g. 7E13CE for if the midway flag was crossed), which then is converted to its base 10 value automatically by the integration tool (for the earlier example, it's now 8262606) to be used by the python environment. Another important part of these variables which had to be specified was their endiannesses, how many bytes they were, and whether or not it was a signed int. These values can be found in [this .json file I built.](https://github.com/NJacobsohn/Your-Learning-is-in-Another-Castle/blob/master/variables/data.json)

After much searching and sifting, I finally found what I think to be a pretty good set of variables to work with. Each variable in the above link had to also be defined in the training scenario for the networks. The [scenario.json file](https://github.com/NJacobsohn/Your-Learning-is-in-Another-Castle/blob/master/scenarios/scenario.json) I built uses the variables I defined in the data.json to define the training environment. The training session is considered done if Mario loses a life or completes the level. The primary reward is distance traveled on the x axis within a level, with considerably large rewards given to reaching the midway checkpoint and completing the whole level. This was done to ensure that the best way to achieve the highest possible score involved beating the level, not using shenanigans like leaving and entering an area to spawn more enemies.

There were many ways I tried to define if a level was beaten, as there's no 0/1 value that just means "Finish line crossed y/n". At first I used a countdown to when your final score is calculated after beating a level, but I found that to be very unreliable. I also tried using a value which has Mario's status in the overworld (level selection screen), but that wouldn't apply until a level was beaten and Mario had returned to the level selection screen. This became an issue as sometimes the network would very quickly be able to enter a new level before the done condition would trigger, then it wouldn't ever trigger due to being inside of a level again. The final decision was a conditional variable that represents how the curren level was exited. This works not only for quickly telling the network it's done when the final calculations were complete, but also properly rewards the network for beating a level.

So we've got all the variables defined and all their locations in memory have been tracked down, now it's time to limit the action space of the environment to prevent the aforementioned idiot actions from occurring. I decided on the following set of 17 actions for the network to be allowed to use:

The following actions have a regular version, and a sprinting version (12 total actions):

- Move Left
- Move Right
- Regular Jump Left
- Regular Jump Right
- Spin Jump Left
- Spin Jump Right

The following actions only exist in these explicitly defined forms (5 actions):

- Regular Jump in place
- Spin Jump in place (allows for bouncing on certain enemies, I wanted to keep it in to see if it'd learn more advanced tactics)
- Look Up
- Look Down (necessary for entering pipes)
- Jump in place and Look Up (necessary for entering pipes on the ceiling)

These actions are defined in a custom wrapper for the environment, which can be explored in my [action discretizer script.](https://github.com/NJacobsohn/Your-Learning-is-in-Another-Castle/blob/master/src/action_discretizer.py)

## **PPO**

In order to properly optimize how these models learn, I adapted a popular reinforcement learning algorithm called Proximal Policy Optimization. I adapted my own version of it to work with keras and retrogym from other projects people have done using PPO and gym. The basics of my implementation of PPO is there are 2 neural networks, an actor and a critic. The actor looks at the state of the game (141312 inputs for numerical observation or a 256x224x3 image for visual observation) and makes a prediction of an action to take at the current timestep. The critic looks at the state of the game and predicts what the reward will be for the next timestep. It subtracts the predicted reward from the actual reward to calculate what's called the advantage, which, along with the previous prediction, is used as the parameters of the loss function of the actor network. Basically the actor picks an action at a given timestep, the critic evaluates what the reward *should* be given the best action was chosen, then optimizes the networks based on how wrong they were.

## **Image vs. Numerical Models**

I touched on this briefly in the PPO explanation, but retrogym offers two different observation types for its emulators. The first and default being visual observations. What this means (this is default settings and can be changed in many ways) is that every frame of the game is a timestep, and each timestep gives a screenshot of the current frame to the network to make a prediction. The network only sees the screen and the varios parts of it. For numerical observation, each time step returns (instead of an image) an array of 16 bit integers of the memory state of the game. That means the model never sees what the game actually looks like, it predicts all of its actions and rewards completely blindly.

There are pitfalls of each of these approaches, for the numerical analysis, it's very easy for the network to memorize exactly how to beat a given level, but the skills aren't transferrable to other levels. It learns stuff like "at x units through the level, a spin jump action doesn't get me killed", but not things like "When I see a gap/goomba/koopa/etc., that means I should jump". So for making a model that's objectively good at Mario (regardless of level), this isn't a good approach. The image analysis side isn't free of issues either though. Using a CNN (even at a small level) can be VERY computationally expensive and drastically increase training times. The image approach, (I'll update this when I tune a CNN more with this game) while at the end of the day produces a better Mario player, takes a lot longer to get to the point of beating levels as it's learning how to play Mario, not necessarily just exactly beat the level it's on as quickly as possible.

## **The Numerical Model**

This is what I feel is a silly model. While it was the easiest to setup, it loves to memorize levels rather than actually just being good at Mario. But ultimately you're this far down this readme because you want to see a neural network play Mario. Well this is the correct section for it!

The following gifs are from a 2 layer network, the first layer had 24 neurons and the second layer had 48. It used tanh activation with the Adam optimizer. (This is the layout of both the actor and critic network). Each episode is an attempt at beating the level, so episode 0 it has no idea what it's doing. As you can see, by episode 50 it started to learn to traverse the level rather than jump around randomly.  

Episode 0                  |  Episode 50
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![nn_episode0][nn_episode0]  |  ![nn_episode50][nn_episode50]

Episode 120 here is an example of showing that the model doesn't just get better each time. It still dies at parts that it had beaten before as it's trying new actions/different jump timings, etc.

But on episode 241, it finally happened. The very first level completion by my own model (might I add, the very first time any iteration of any of my models beat a level)

Episode 120                  |  Episode 241
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![nn_episode120][nn_episode120]  |  ![nn_episode241][nn_episode241]

## **The Image Model**

This model is still under construction!

## **Conclusion**

Currently the only model that is up and running is the numerical model, so I don't have any evidence that one type may be better than another. I have a hunch that a CNN will be better overall, as it'd learn things like jumping when seeing an enemy (rather than jumping at 852 units in the level or something).

## **What's Next?**

- Get my PPO implementation to work with CNNs
- Plot relative learning rates (by looking at rewards) of NN and CNN
- Implement other optimization algorithms and/or models
- View how model(s) performance changes from level to level
- Train a "master" model of each type on various levels in hopes of creating a TAS machine
